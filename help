Weed System Project Documentation
Overview
The Weed System project is a PHP-based application designed to manage and track the growth, cultivation, and inventory of cannabis plants. This system helps farmers, growers, and cannabis businesses to streamline operations and improve efficiency in managing their plants. It tracks the plantâ€™s lifecycle, records environmental conditions, and monitors the entire cultivation process, from seedling to harvest. The system also integrates with inventory management, ensuring that all harvested products are logged and accounted for.

This document provides a brief overview of the key components and features of the project, as well as instructions on how to install and use the system.

Features
The Weed System project offers the following core features:

Plant Lifecycle Management:

Track individual plants from the seedling stage to full growth and harvest.
Record important details like strain type, growth phase, and environmental conditions (light, humidity, temperature).
Environment Monitoring:

Input and monitor environmental data to optimize plant health.
Log temperature, humidity, and other key variables during plant growth.
Inventory Tracking:

Manage harvested cannabis products and store them in the system's inventory module.
Track product quantities and handle sales or distribution records.
Grow Schedule Management:

Schedule and track important events like watering, fertilization, pruning, and pest control.
Set reminders and alerts for tasks required during the growth process.
User Management:

Multiple user roles and permissions (e.g., Admin, Grower, Inventory Manager).
Secure login and user authentication to ensure access is limited to authorized personnel.
Reporting and Analytics:

Generate reports on plant growth, harvest yields, and inventory.
Analyze environmental conditions to determine the best growing practices.
